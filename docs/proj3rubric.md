|3| short release cycles|3 releases can be seen in GitHub. https://github.com/kingan1/application-tracking-system/releases|
|3| workload is spread over the whole team (so one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others...|Everyone contributed and had commits. Can be seen in insights https://github.com/kingan1/application-tracking-system/graphs/contributors?from=2021-11-01&to=2021-12-04&type=c|
|3|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing | Readme.md, docs/app.md, test_app.md https://github.com/kingan1/application-tracking-system/blob/main/readme.md|
|3|the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up  | Have contributing.md file https://github.com/kingan1/application-tracking-system/blob/main/Contributing.md|

|3|evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people) | Everyone has a working instance of the project locally. All the team members are using the same IDE and have all the required packages installed.|
|3|evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the codebase |We assign issues in Github and start working on the required part of the project. The commit history of different members shows this. https://github.com/kingan1/application-tracking-system/projects/1|
|3|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation)  |in Readme.md, docs/app.md, test_app.md |
