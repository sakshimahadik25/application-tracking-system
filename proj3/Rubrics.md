|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing |1| Yes, animations, videos, motivation, etc.|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.	|1| Evidence in GH - [Readme.md](https://github.com/Kashika08/application-tracking-system/blob/main/readme.md)|
